Cloud application systems running on top of by 
    container orchestration systems such as Kubernetes are often managed 
    by domain-specific controller code called operator to automate laborious 
    manually-done operations. The correctness and the reliability of such code 
    is critical to productionized application yet operators are highly complex and difficult to ensure correctness. 
We conduct empirical study on popular Kubernetes operator from a software engineering perspective to characterize its quantitative complexity.
We propose a metrics that ...
