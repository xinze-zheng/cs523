    Cloud application systems running on top of by container orchestration systems
    such as Kubernetes are often managed by domain-specific controller code called
    operator to automate laborious manually-done operations. The correctness and
    the reliability of such code is critical to productionized application yet
    operators are highly complex and difficult to ensure correctness. We conduct
    empirical study on 52 popular Kubernetes operator from a software engineering
    perspective to characterize their complexity and testing practices.
