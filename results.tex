\subsection{What are the challenges in writing reliable operator?}
\subsection{What are the developers' challenges?}
Operators are responsible for operating a very specifc managed system and it is
operators' job to reconcile the managed system to the desired state given
users' expectation. Modern software systems can be gigantuous with tens of
thousands lines of code and complicated states management required. This
engenders burdens for operator developers to understand the managed system
thoroughly, increasing the likelyhood for them to make mistakes in developing
the operator.

In Figure\ref{fig:contributor}, we collect and visualize the involvement of
operator developers in contributing to the managed system using GitHub
repository contributor data. While the absence of operator develoipers'
contribution to the managed system does not necessarily imply their
incompetence in understanding the managed system, it is a still a reflective
metric on the average familiarity of operator developers on the managed system.
In our dataset, only 19\% of the operator projects have more than half of the
developers being contributing to the managed system. The proportion of
developers who are also developing the managed system drops as the operator
project gets larger. In the two largest operator project in our dataset, with
regard to the size of developers, only 10\% of the developers are contributors
to both the managed system and its operator.
