There are previous efforts in understanding device driver in modern system\cite{Kadav:2012}.
The operator shares a very similar figure with the devce driver. 
Both of them impose the challenges of reliably bridging the gap between managed system and the underlying operating system interfaces,
    while the underlying system for device driver is operating system and the underlying system for the operator is Kubernetes.
Though both modern operating system and cloud management system are complicated, interacting with cloud management system 
    faces even more problems in handling distributed asynchronous issues.
The cloud environment raises new classes of reliability challenges like staleness and faults when interacting with cloud management system\cite{Sun:2022}
    ,which requires extra attention from operator developers to avoid bugs.
This work focuses on both common reliability problem faced by operator and device driver, 
    and the newly raised reliability problem in the cloud environment.
